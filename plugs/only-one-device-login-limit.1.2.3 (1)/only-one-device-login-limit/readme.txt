Limit login to one device at a time for a user. Configured options from the admin

== Description ==

This plugin limits login to one device at a time for a user.
If the same user login from another device, that user won't be allowed to log in.
Admin can set up an 'Already login message' for that user.

If the user has been inactive for too long, then the user is automatically logged out and that user allows to log in again either from the same device or another device.
Admin can set up 'Auto Logout Duration' for users.

It tracks the user's activity like user status ( Active/Inactive ) and Last active time.
Admin can view user status from  WP Admin > Users > All users.  From the "User Status" column, the user current status can be viewed.

Admin can set up only one device login limit plugin from WP Admin > Settings > Coder limit login

Note: This plugin is compatible with most of the membership plugins.
